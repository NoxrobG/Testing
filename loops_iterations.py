#nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#Loops for Break and Continue
# for num in nums:
#     if num == 3:
#         print('Found!')
#         continue (can also replace with break if you want to loop to stop once it found the num 3)
#     print(num)

#continous loop:

# for num in nums:
#     for letter in 'abc':
#         print(num, letter)

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(i)

while True:
    # if x == 5:
    #     break
    print(x)
    x += 1
# if you have an infinate loop most OS will allow you to press CRTL + C to end the loop.
